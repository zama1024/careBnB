# CareBNB

CareBNB is an Airbnb inspired web application created by Md Farshid Zaman. It has the same features as Airbnb where a user can book homes/rooms for a given number of days in any city. One distinctive feature that CareBNB have is that a certain percentage of the rent(chosen by the host) will go towards charity. Take a look at it live at [http://www.carebnb.site](http://www.carebnb.site). Once signed up, users can log in and create listings or book homes for their next vacation.
